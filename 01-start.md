## Break down your problems

Whatever problems or task you are facing in your life and how big it may seem you can conquer it easily if you divide your big problem into a dozen smaller ones.

> The divide and conquer strategy is a great approach to complete your tasks.

## Keep practicing

The key to master any art is to practice consistently. If you learn to code just fifteen minutes a day you'll build a daily habit to code everyday. This will be beneficial to you greatly in the long run.

Consistent practice is key to learning programming. But what will you practice? Is the main question here. Well, you can create small projects or re-make existing ones to hone your skill set.

Don’t blindly follow tutorials mix them up. Try to add your own touch in each tutorial that you follow. Use a different API, change the design, add new features, Whatever is it that you’re building try adding a personal touch to your project.

Try building a complete app on your own. Find a problem and try to fix it. One of the biggest benefits of building real projects, is that you have something to show when applying for jobs. 

The ability to take a problem description and turn it into a fully-fledged solution, that can be shared online, is a great skill to have.

The problem with coding tutorials is that there are no errors or bugs in that video and this is the opposite of real life. Try making your own projects and if you get stuck then ask for help or look at a tutorial.

## Narrow your focus

Coding is one of the broadest industries in the world. If you’re a developer, there is a lot of things that you can learn.

you can learn back-end, front-end, data science, mobile, Cloud, and in all of the different languages like JavaScript, C#, Ruby or Python. That have frameworks and tools like Wordpress, Express, Ruby on Rails, Laravel or Django.

Even after all that there is still a lot of things left like: UI/UX design, copy writing, database management, deployments, DevOps etc. And this is not event the full list.

The thing is that you can never learn all of these things in your life. You’ll have to create your own path by selecting only those things that you wanna learn and forget about everything else.

Pick a set of skills and then try to master them. Having knowledge of how everything works together is a great thing but this can make you go off track.

## Focus on the fundamentals

Whatever language you choose, you’ll need to get familiar with the libraries and frameworks of that language at some point.

Frameworks are great, because they help you get productive quickly. They make sure you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, but can use what people have already built for you. The issue with frameworks is that it can be hard to understand what is really going on.

Frameworks tend to abstract a lot of stuff away from you, which is a good thing when you’re experienced, but can be a big downside when you’re learning. 

Another problem with frameworks is that they can quickly shift in popularity. Some years ago, jQuery was the most important tool you needed for front-end development. Now, frameworks like React and Vue are taking its place. It’s impossible to predict how this will change in the future.

As a beginner, you need to focus on the fundamentals of your language. Fundamentals are what will stand the test of time. Get good with those, and you can always adapt and learn frameworks on top of them.

## Solving problems

As developers, our job is actually not to write code. As counter intuitive as that may sound, our real job is to solve problems. On a broad scale, we’ll be solving problems for users and businesses. And on a smaller scale, we’ll be solving concrete coding problems.

That’s why learning how to problem solve is one of the most important skill sets in our developer toolbox. To solve problems efficiently, we first need to break them down as much as possible. 

A great way to practice problem solving is by using online platforms designed for this particular task. leetcode is a great example, but you can pick whichever platform you prefer.

When you tackle a problem, approach it in a very pragmatic way:

- Read the problem description thoroughly, to make sure you understand exactly what you are trying to do.

- Solve the problem in the most naive, brute forcing way. Don’t worry about performance or code readability in the beginning.

- When you have it working, try to think of refactoring it. Can you make the code easier to understand? Can you make it perform better while maintaining the functionality?

- After refactoring, try to see how other people have solved this and then add their solution to yours.

Try to solve the problem in your mind before you start writing code. Take a paper and pen and write down the solution before you get started.

## Reading third-party code

Developers spend a lot of time reading code. You will probably spend more time reading code than actually writing it.

So learning how to properly read code is a key skill to master. Reading code is about your understanding of what a particular piece of code is doing. There’s several different scenarios where this proves useful:

- Understanding code from a tutorial so you can modify it to your needs.

- Trying to familiarize yourself with a new code base at work or in open source.

- Debugging third-party code from a dependency in your project

- Understanding what on Earth is going on in the code you wrote last night, or last week, or 6 months ago.

Knowing how to effectively read code will help you understand what the code is meant to do, and it’ll be easier for you to modify it or fix bugs.

## Clean code

If reading code is something every developer does daily, it stands to reason that we should write readable code. This will help ourselves now, ourselves down the road, and anyone else who might come in contact with our code. Writing readable code is also extremely important for maintainability.

If your code is easily readable it can be expanded and adapt to any situation that can arise. There are a few things to keep in mind when writing code so that it can be easily maintained.

- Use descriptive variable names. Don’t use names like “a”, “x” or “test”. They don’t convey any meaning, and make it harder to understand what the code is doing at a glance. Instead, use names that describe what the variable represents.

- Split code into several functions. Each function should do only one thing. If you find yourself with a large block of code that is doing multiple things, split it up into smaller functions.

- Don’t create fancy one-liners if the code is easier to read as several lines.

## Concepts and patterns

The ability to understand higher-level concepts and notice patterns is a great skill for developers to have. If you think about it, a lot of stuff that we do is similar between projects.

Recognizing these areas, and creating the proper abstractions for them, will help you quickly get started with new projects.

- **CRUD:** Almost all software performs the basic task of creating, showing, updating, and deleting data. This process is called CRUD and its present in almost every single software.

- **Forms:** Forms are how we can get data from a user and almost every application has form in it. There are many types of fields that are available in forms. Choosing the right field for the right type data and knowing how to validate it can help you build great forms.

## Engineering principles

In the development industry, you might hear of certain software engineering principles. A lot of these tend to be very technical, like the SOLID principles which can be confusing to beginners and they don’t apply to every scenario.

Here are some of the more common and easier ones that you should know:

- **YAGNI:** It stands for you aren’t gonna need it. And the idea behind is that don’t implement functions in your app that you don’t need. This will only add more burden on you and will make your app bloated.

- **KISS:** The Keep it simple ,stupid principle says that you must always try to keep you app as simple as possible for both developers and users alike. Don’t implement a feature in a way that your users find it hard to understand as well as making that code hard to maintain.

- DRY: Always keep your code DRY. This means that don’t repeat yourself. If you’re making a global navigation make it a separate component and don’t create a new one for each link.

- **WET:** Writing everything twice is the opposite of DRY and it can be useful in certain situations.

## Perfect code

The idea of writing a program that is perfect is just nonsense. There is no project on earth that is perfect in the sense that it has no bugs and vulnerabilities and has the greatest source code ever written.

Perfect code exists in a sense that it can do the task it was made to do. It will have bugs and most of the code will be a mess but it performs exactly like how we want it to.

When you let go of the idea of perfect code, it also opens up the possibility of using code that other developers have written.

This can be from StackOverflow, GitHub or any third party. Using these libraries and code snippets is completely fine. You don’t want to reinvent the wheel and spend time solving problems that others have solved in better ways than you. The exception being if you’re writing something as a learning process.

## Staying Pragmatic

Learn how to debug issues, without losing your temper, it is one of the most important parts of being a developer. It’s easy to get frustrated by code. In your head, you know what you want to do. But the code is just not working. There can be a million reasons why.

In these situations, it’s important to take a pragmatic approach and look at the issue logically:

- Read through your code line by line. You might be overlooking a simple thing that you’re not thinking about. Go into each function and make sure it looks the way you intend.

- Ask for a second pair of eyes. Sometimes you miss obvious things when you’re too close to the problem. Asking a co-worker or someone online for help can often point out the mistake

- Talk through your solution out loud (rubber duck debugging). This is one of the oldest tricks in the book. It involves forcing yourself to explain your code to an inanimate object.

- Take a break. Sometimes the most effective debugging tool is a breath of fresh air, a quick bite to eat, or a good night's sleep. Giving your brain time to rest, and coming back with a refreshed mind, will allow you to approach the problem logically.

- Read the error messages! It’s far too common to just see an error, think you know what the problem is, and then making a change that might have nothing to do with the actual error.
