# Getting hired

## Applying for jobs

You'll never know when you are ready to apply for jobs, especially if you’re new to development. You don’t really know how much companies expect you to know, and you don’t know what you don’t know.

If you don't have any experience and want to apply for internships have at least three complete projects and a personal website live to show it to your employers. Narrowing down on job offers is also a great way to get the job you want. By narrowing down I mean that if you're a frontend developer only apply to frontend jobs. This might take same time but it will be worth it.

## Which type of company to apply for

For your first development job, It is highly recommend that you apply for larger companies. The type of company isn’t too important, but bigger companies tend to be better suited to junior developers.

At a large company you'll probably recieve some training and greater pay. They are mostly relaxed when it comes to work loads and don't overwork thier employees.

Working for a startup on the other hand, can be a very busy and low-paying job becuase the company is relatively new they won't have much income to pay thier employees. This can be a great environment to learn, because you’ll experience the importance of deadlines first-hand. You’ll likely get more responsibility, which further increases the speed at which you learn and grow.  

## Create a great resume

Your resume will be the first point of contact with the company you’re applying for. It’s absolutely crucial that your resume creates a good first impression. The entire goal of your resume is to get the recruiter or company to advance you to the next step in the hiring process.

There’s a lot of stuff that goes into creating a compelling resume, but most importantly: you have to adapt your resume to the job you’re applying for. One of the most common mistakes is to send the same resume to 500 companies and hope to hear back. This doesn’t work. Instead, you need to personalize your resume to match the job spec.

If you’re applying for a React job, put your React projects on top of your project list. If you’re applying for a data science job, highlight your strong Python capabilities. 

Keep it at 1-2 page maximum. The receiver will simply not have time to read long walls of text. There might be potentially better candidates applying for this job, but by keeping your resume concise, you’ll get an advantage over them by actually having your resume read.

Put your experience and skills at the top. This is the most important part of the resume, so make sure the receiver doesn’t accidentally miss it, or discard your resume before getting to these sections. 

Have a friend proofread as well. You want your resume to be as free of spelling mistakes and poor wording as possible. 

## Create an online presence

Your online presence is everything that shows up when someone types your name into Google. It can be your website, your Twitter account, LinkedIn, and any other social accounts you use.  

It’s important that these media provide a clear picture of who you are, and that they show your most professional side. 

Another great way to stand out, is to have a blog. A blog will do many great things for your career, but it’s especially important to further build your online presence. It shows that you care enough about development to actually write about it in your free time.
