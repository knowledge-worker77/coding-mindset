# The coding mindset

## Impostor syndrome

Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which one doubts one's accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a 'fraud'.

Impostor syndrome is a huge problem among developers. It is this feeling of not being good enough. That you will never be good enough. And that sooner or later, someone will figure out that you don’t know how to code at all.

There are a couple of things that you can do that will help you get rid of your impostor syndrome

- Realize that everybody goes through it and it's completely normal.
- Look at your progress. Chances are that you’ve already improved a lot since you started coding. Keep reminding yourself how far you’ve come.
- Remember that you're never done learning to code. You need to stop seeing programming as something you either know, or don’t know, and instead view it as a continuous journey.

## Experience over intelligence

As a developer, you will run into countless problems throughout your career. Some of these will be easy, but most will be hard.

If you get stuck on a problem for too long the imposter syndrome will start to kick in and you'll start feeling bad about yourself that you're not good for enough for this.

But, in reality it's just your thinking thats wrong.  You need to shift your mindset from “I can’t do this, I’m not smart enough” to "I haven't done this before, I’m inexperienced".

When you do that, every problem becomes a matter of whether you've solved it before or not, rather than if you're intellectually capable of solving it (because you are). This shift in your mindset from "I'm stupid" to "I'm inexperienced" leads to the natural solution that you just need more experience. Which you get through practice and just BEING a developer. 

## Focus on yourself

Stop comparing yourself to other people. You should only compare yourself to your past self and see how far you've come. 

It’s very easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to other developers. Especially on social media platforms like Twitter, with tons of amazing developers that all seem smarter than you. They make more money, they have more followers, and they're probably better coders.

The truth about social media is that the developers on there only want to show you thier achievements and not their struggles. You rarely see tweets talking about the 4 hours someone spent debugging a CSS issue, or the long nights of struggling to implement a small new feature in an iOS app.

Everybody is on their own journey. You don’t know how far someone else is along theirs. So it doesn’t do much good to compare yourself to them. Maybe they’ve been programming for 10 years? Or maybe their brain is wired in a way that they can quickly pick up new languages, but struggle with other fundamental developer skills? There’s no way of knowing. 

Fundamentally, everybody learns at a different pace. And everybody has periods with a lot of growth and new knowledge influx, and periods that feel more stagnant. Some concepts might stick easier to one group of people, but be almost impossible to grasp for another group - and vice-versa.

## Measuring progress

Measure your progress It can be tough to measure your own progress, but it’s important to create confidence and use your improvement as motivation to grow even further. 

Coding is a marathon, not a sprint. You don’t need to become a rockstar coder and land your dream job in 2 weeks. Take it slow, improve a bit day by day, and measure your progress. 

Looking at other people’s success, and trying to learn how they got there, is a great way to improve yourself. Just don’t be worried that you aren’t quite there yet. Learn from them what you can, and use that to progress on your own journey. 

## Communication is key

As a developer, you will be communicating with people every single day, regardless of your field. It doesn't matter if you work in a small team, a large team or by yourself.

Communication is an absolute key skill to master to have a successful development career. There are two different types of communication, and which one you use most often will depend on your particular situation, but both are super important to know and be good at. 

There’s written communication, and spoken communication. For us developers, a majority of our communication tends to be written. 

Written communication is just where I feel there is the most opportunity to improve for a lot of people. Below is a list of some of my absolute favorite "hacks" to improve your written communication ten-fold: 

- Preef-read everything and try to understand yourself what you're trying to tell the other person before sending them the email or message.

- Use a professional tone in your writing when communicating with collegues or managers.

- Keep your message or email short and simple and to the point. Don't go writing two-page paragraphs for just a simple syntax error.

## Working with a team

Developers mostly work with teams and some times the teams are not developers, It could be the marketing team, the IT team or the project managers. Whether you like it or not, these people are your teammates, and you need to work together to reach the common objective.

When someone else is communicating, make it a habit to really listen to what they have to say. Even if you disagree, and have your own ideas about something, you will learn so much by keeping an open mind and listening properly.

 When working with other people, you absolutely need to leave your ego at the door. There's no room for it in any team environment. If your ego is more important to you than collaborating to create the best possible solution, you're going to be hurting the team, and ultimately the business.

## Accepting feedback

When you work in a team, you need to be able to take feedback. Actually, even if you work by yourself, learning how to take feedback is a great skill to improve yourself in the field of software development.

Being criticized is never fun, and can severely hurt your confidence. But being able to filter the criticism, locate the important points, and use those as opportunities to improve is an incredible skill. 

## Creating Value

The end user doesn't care about what framework or library you used in his project, He just wants you to build their product. Developers sometimes get caught up in technicalities and forget the real reason that we code is to create value for people.

Some fileds of programming overlap with other fields and depend upon the developers to help them. If you’re a data scientist in a big corporation, your users are likely other employees, like marketing or sales people. They need to understand the numbers and graphs you create in order to drive sales.
