# Productivity

## Learning how to learn

Software development is one of the fastest changing industries on the planet. There’s always new languages, frameworks, libraries or tools coming out.

Learning how to learn is the art of being able to quickly pick up new skills as they come along. This will be useful throughout your entire coding career, and it’s the absolute fastest way to increase your productivity.

You need to figure out how you learn best. Some people learn best from reading books, some learn best from video, appreciating the visual elements and being able to follow along. Some learn by reading documentation and source code. And others learn best by just jumping into the code and failing along the way. There is no right or wrong way. What matters is that you find the style that works for you.

Narrow your focus to one thing at a time. If you want to learn React, make sure you understand the others first. Then, focus only on learning React. Not NextJS, not Styled Components, and definitely not webpack.

When you’ve decided on a particular thing to learn, it’s time to put in the
work. It will take some time. There’s no shortcuts but there is some advice that might speed things up:

- **Keep grinding:** Practice as much as you can and learn as much as you can.
- **Make mistakes:** By coding a lot, you will make mistakes. By making mistakes and figuring it out why. This way you will the learn the ins-and-outs of what you’re trying to internalize.
- **Asking questions**: When you get stuck on something, try asking others. Either in person at your job, or online. There’s helpful people all around you.
- **Take notes:** Writing stuff down can be really helpful for you if get stuck with something in the future.
- **Teaching others:** If you want to fully understand a topic try teaching it other people. This way you'll realize just how much of it you actually understand and it will benefit the other person as well.
- **Setup a timer:** Use the Pomodoro technique when working when the timer stops you also stop. this way you won't get distracted and won't feel burned out.
- **Remove distractions:** Put your phone in another room when you're learning and minimize all of the things that can distract you.

## Making it a habit

If you put aside time to learn coding everyday soon it will become one of your habits and you will be doing it automatically. Developing health habits and increasing your productivity also makes you more hire-able than others.

Staying motivated to learn programming is a really hard task because once you get stuck on a problem you'll think of quitting and will think that this is too hard and that's where good habits come and help you.

Humans are social creature and we crave feedback, any kind of feedback. This is also important when your learning to code and having your code reviewed by others could help you learn faster and other people can find mistakes in your code that might've missed.

Your code doesn't need to be *perfect* it should just perform the task it needs to perform. You can refactor your code after you've completed your goal. If you fall into the mindset that your code needs to be perfect every time you'll never be able to meet deadlines and push any code because you'll be busy in making your code perfect.

## Get comfortable with your tools

Always picking the right tool for the job is considered a best practice in almost every industry. There are many tools available that can be useful for the tasks that we developers perform daily.

- **Code editor:** There are many code editors available as well as full-fledged IDEs for almost every programming language. Pick the one which you like best customize it, learn it's keyboard shortcuts or create your own, add extensions or plugins to suite your needs, and this will be your companion through the rigorous journey that lies ahead.
- **Get comfortable with the terminal:** Most of the time you'l spend time in your code editor and your terminal. The terminal can be scary-looking at first but it's actually easy and fun to use and most of your job will require you to use a terminal based interface if you're a back-end or DevOps engineer. Try to learn some Linux commands as well while you're at it.
- **Learning to google:** Everyone can use google, but learning how to find the exactly what you're looking for quickly is a great skill to have. If you get stuck on a error carefully read it and then search the exact same thing and you'll find your solution.
- **Version control:** Calamities can struck anytime without telling you. It's best if you learn how to backup and version your code using git and upload it to GitHub which is a online platform for storing your code.

## Take breaks

When you're doing a 9-5 job and then spend a few hours to learn a new technology or language you'll get bored of doing the same thing all the time.

To avoid being brunt out take breaks from coding. Go to the gym, hangout with friends, or watch Netflix. You can always continue where you left from.
